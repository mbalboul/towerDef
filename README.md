This is the readme for Generic Tower Defense Genre Thingy.

There is one thing you should know.  You will want to have a version of PyGame installed,
preferrably one that works with Python 2.
This is all you will need before playtesting the game.  After that, you should be able to run the code and execute it.

So... playtest it and tell me about the gameplay!  Then, read the code and tell me what you think about my formatting!
Thank you for reading this readme!  Now get to work-...err, play.  Yeah.
